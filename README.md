## Text Emotion Classification

This project focuses on classifying emotions in text data using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models. Emotions play a crucial role in understanding user sentiments, making this project relevant for applications like sentiment analysis in customer feedback, social media monitoring, and more.

### Key Features:

- Data Exploration and Visualization: Analyzed the distribution of emotions in the dataset using data visualization techniques like Pie Charts, Word Clouds, and Histograms.

- Word Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering to group words based on their vector representations. Visualized the clusters to gain insights into word similarity.

- Text Pre-processing: Implemented essential text cleaning steps such as removing stopwords, URLs, and HTML tags. Also handled contractions and special characters.

- TF-IDF Vectorization: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Trained multiple models including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Classifier for emotion classification. Achieved an accuracy of 91.67% using Support Vector Machines.
